# **myPocket — Smart Budget App**

A simple personal finance assistant that I built because most finance tools online are either paid, overcomplicated, or locked behind premium plans.
I just wanted something clean: **add income, add expenses, see savings, and get a clear financial score.**
So I built it myself — and used it as a way to learn backend through real tasks.

---

## ⭐ **Why I Built This**

While searching for websites that show spending insights or calculate FIRE numbers, almost everything useful was premium.
Also, I wanted a real project to learn backend using **task-based learning**, not theory.

So I made my own tool:

* A clean UI I can use daily
* A project that helps me learn Spring Boot later
* No premium restrictions, no ads, just practical features

---

## 🚀 **Features**

* Add monthly income (slider UI)
* Add expenses with category & timestamp
* Smart preset buttons (₹100, ₹500, ₹1K…)
* Auto-calculates:

  * Total income
  * Total expenses
  * Savings
* **Financial Health Score (0–100)**
* Live recommendations to improve spending
* Dark mode / Light mode toggle
* Undo & delete expense
* LocalStorage saving
* Fully responsive clean UI

---

## 🧱 **Tech Stack**

### **Frontend**

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (Vanilla DOM)

### **Backend (Coming Soon)**

* Spring Boot
* MySQL
* REST APIs for:

  * Saving income/expense data
  * Monthly analytics
  * FIRE number calculation
  * User accounts

## 🏗️ **How the Project Helped Me Learn**

I used this project to learn JavaScript and will use it again to learn Spring Boot.
Every feature (income slider, scoring, saving to storage, theme toggle) became a small **task-based learning** step — which works way better for me than learning theory first.
